diesel cars have been renowned for having exceptional fuel economy and long term reliability because of their material construction and design , they have been used extensively in most of the heavy equipment applications. The higher air to fuel ratio makes them fuel sippers when compared to gasoline powered counterparts , a typical diesel engine is made of cast iron or forged aluminium , with strength and structural integrity in mind , making them endure shocks and vibrations , which enable them to be durable which aids longevity. Since diesel engines operate by compression ignition unlike petrol engines which works by spark ignition, they need higher compression ratios to operate need a longer stroke than the bore making them rev much lower than a typical petrol engine, that low rpm operation cycle alleviates a lot of stress which would be induced by high rpm operations.
